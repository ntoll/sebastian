This is the beginnings of a library and test suite for reading lilypond
fragments.

lilypond.interp.parse will take a lilypond fragment and generate a series of
tuples of the form (offset, note_value, duration) where offset and duration
is measured in 64th notes and note_value is the MIDI note number.

To ensure trailing rests don't get lost, some tuples are of the form
(offset, -1, -1) which don't correspond to any note but instead mark the end
of the block.

You can run unit tests with

    ./tests.py
