# this is just an initial sketch of the data structures so don't read too 
# much into them at this stage.

# basically, a Sequence is just a list of Points and a Point is just a dict
# giving values to certain Attributes.
#
# currently, Sequence assumes the Points have OFFSET_64 attribute values and
# will also make use of the DURATION_64 attribute. I'm not completely happy
# with this coupling but not sure how else to do it given Sequence needs to
# be offset aware.
#
# see datastructure_notes.txt for some of the thinking behind this whole
# approach and a bit of roadmap as to where things are headed.


# this str subclass exists as we may later add methods
