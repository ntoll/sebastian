This is a library for parsing and writing Standard MIDI Files (SMFs)

The parser currently just outputs the data it finds and can be run with

    ./midi.py [midi-file]

write_midi.py is intended to be used as a library for generating MIDI files
and, while currently limited, can be seen in action in in_c/in_c2midi.py
