This directory contains a first pass at the score for In C in lilypond format
as well as the beginnings of code for generating a performance of In C.

Running

    ./in_c2midi.py

will, depending on which function is called at the top-level in the source
code, either generate a MIDI file for each In C pattern or a single MIDI file
with each of the patterns played once.

The next step is to support multiple instruments and aleatoric repetitions.
